# Docker_Compose_Quickstart

1. From your project directory, start up your application by running docker compose up.

2. Enter http://localhost:8000/ in a browser to see the application running.

If this doesn't resolve, you can also try http://127.0.0.1:8000.

You should see a message in your browser saying:

        Hello World! I have been seen 1 times.

3. Refresh the page.

The number should increment.

        Hello World! I have been seen 2 times.

You can see it in the third commit.
